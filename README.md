## Project description
Films of dipolar molecules formed by physical vapour deposition are in general spontaneously polarized, with implications ranging from electron transfer in molecular optoelectronic devices to the properties of astrochemical ices in the interstellar medium. Polarization arises from dipole orientation which intuitively should decrease with increasing deposition temperature, T. However experimentally it is found that minimum or maximum values in polarization vs T may be observed for cis-methyl formate, 1-propanol and ammonia. A continuous analytic form of polarization vs T is developed which has the property that it is not differentiable at all T. The minima and maxima in polarization vs T are marked by singularities in the differential of this analytic form. This exotic behaviour is presently unique to films of dipolar species and has not been reported, for example, in the related magnetic phases of spin glasses.
