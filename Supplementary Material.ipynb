    "### Abstract <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"abstract\"></a>\n",
    "_This letter concerns the properties of thin molecular films, formed by condensation from the gas phase. These films, when composed of small dipolar species, such as nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, an array of alcohols and many others, exhibit spontaneous polarization at sufficiently low deposition temperature. These species demonstrate the so-called ‘spontelectric effect’  resulting in internal electric fields which may exceed 10<sup>8</sup> Vm<sup>-1</sup>. Our focus here is on the functional relationship between the degree of polarization of these films and their temperature of deposition, T. The degree of polarization may be represented as proportional, through the Langevin function,  to Coth($\\xi$/T) - ($\\xi$/T)<sup>-1</sup>, using atomic units. Here $\\xi$ is the energy of interaction of an average dipole with the mean effective field in the film. We see below that the effective field is itself a function of the degree of polarization and show how this relationship, between polarization and deposition temperature, leads to total differentials which may become singular for specific temperature and corresponding polarization._"

For 1-butanol and 1-pentanol, values of _s_ are estimated from the molecular volume, $\\Omega$, and through comparison with values of this parameter determined for the similarly glassy solid cis-methyl formate, for which it is found that the separation of species is given by the radius associated with a sphere of volume $\\Omega$. Values of $\\Omega$ ($\\pm$_12%_) are given  by $(\\alpha/0.0084161)^{3/4}$ where polarizabilities may be estimated to be 3.53 x 10<sup>-30</sup> m<sup>3</sup> and 3.73 x 10<sup>-30</sup> m<sup>3</sup> for 1-butanol and 1-pentanol.
